# 🏠 House Rent Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting **house rent prices** based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, furnishing status, and other property-related factors.  
It is a **mini machine learning project** built using Python and popular data science libraries.

## 📌 Project Overview

House rent prices vary depending on multiple factors. The goal of this project is to build a **regression model** that can accurately estimate the rent of a house based on given input features.

This project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training & evaluation
- Prediction using trained ML models
